==========

Useful for those who use their iMac as a monitor for their Macbook.

Automatically toggles off your iMac's Bluetooth and turns on Target Display Mode when you connect a Macbook via Thunderbolt.

To use, build and run. Might want to run at startup. When you plug your notebook into your iMac via Thunderbolt,
this extention will automatically switch the iMac to Target Display Mode, allowing you to use your iMac as a monitor.

In addition, it will turn off the Bluetooth on the iMac, freeing up your mouse and keyboard to pair with your notebook.
When you unplug the notebook, the iMac's Bluetooth will be powered back up and the monitor restored.

Quit from the status bar menu.
